# Find the Star! (Github Edition)

## About

It's an web app using which you can search for github users by entering their name in search bar sorted by the number of followers.

## How does it work?
1. Enter the name of the user you want to search.
2. You will get results in case any user with that name exists, else it will result empty list.
3. The users are displayed as a list of cardview, from left-> right and then top to bottom.
4. By clicking on any user's card view, you can see more information about the user.
5. It supports pagination as well.


## Need to add
1. Authentication to have more API request's ability.
2. Instead of pagination - Infinite scrolling could be added to better UX


## Interesting concepts used
1. Debouncing - To optimize the performance and rate limit the number of API calls.
2. Pagination
3. Asynchronous API requests.
